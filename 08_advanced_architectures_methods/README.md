 **Homework**
 
 Submit a paragraph about: 
 
- How could you use AI for a problem that interests you? 
I would like to use AI to create better predictive models for the negative impacts of climate change on disadvantaged groups around the world. Parts of the world with the least amount of resources such as fresh drinking water, access to the internet, access to healthcare, etc. 

- What is the task?
Predicitve models now can be biased and focus on groups that will fare better in a drought our blackout and provide them with immediate resources. There are people still people suffering from hurricanes that hit several years ago and there aren't many resources being made available to them. I would like to work on the bias in AI and make that kind of technology work for everyone but especially people of color, not just the people most noticeable in a disaster.

- What kind of data would you use? 
I would use data that acknowledges the differences in people and uses data of what's happened in the past to create a model that helps the most negatively impacted first. Typically people with higher incomes are given better insurances and better care but the people with less money need those opportunites more because they have less.

- What kind of method or model might be appropriate? 
Large scale training and modern neural networks to include data of what happens AFTER an incident and how disproportionate resources can get for people of color.

- What kind of metric would you use to measure success? 
I would measure success based on how far reaching resources are predicted to go - the demographics that are reached based on a certain area. I would measure success based on how many people the model predicts can be helped and how far reaching the negative impacts are of a natural disaster.

Feel free to consult the Internet for ideas.

This paragraph can be placed in a README in git and you can submit the link.
